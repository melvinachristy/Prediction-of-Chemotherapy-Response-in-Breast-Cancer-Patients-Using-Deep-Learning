# Prediction-of-Chemotherapy-Response-in-Breast-Cancer-Patients-Using-Deep-Learning
**Timeline:** Dec 2024 – May 2025  
**Institution:** Karunya University  

## Overview
This project develops a **deep learning model** to predict **chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients** using **clinical and imaging data**. The goal is to support **personalized treatment strategies** and **precision medicine** by identifying responders vs. non-responders early, improving therapy effectiveness, and minimizing unnecessary side effects.  

## Objectives
- **Build robust models** to predict chemotherapy response.  
- **Analyze patient-specific features** to identify early treatment efficacy.  
- **Discover biomarkers & clinical factors** influencing therapy success.  
- **Improve treatment protocols** with targeted, personalized approaches.  

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Architectures**: CNNs, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionResNetV2, and Transformer-based models.  
- **Data Integration**: Combined **imaging**, **clinical**, and **genomic** data for holistic analysis.  
- **High Prognostic Accuracy**: Achieved strong predictive performance in outcome classification.  
- **Biomarker Identification**: Provided insights into features influencing treatment efficacy.  
- **Explainability (XAI)**: Integrated model interpretation for clinical trust.

## Installation & Setup

You don’t need a heavy local setup — this project can be run directly in **Google Colab**.

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C3rQD57IJuZ9YpN0O7CXxqxUS-iUW_Xu?usp=sharing)

2. Once opened, connect to a runtime (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU` for faster training).

3. Run all cells in order (`Runtime > Run all`) to:
   - Preprocess datasets  
   - Train deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2)  
   - Evaluate results with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC)  
   - Visualize predictions (ROC curves, Grad-CAM heatmaps)  

## Usage (Colab)

- Simply open the notebook above and execute the code blocks step by step.  
- No local installation required.  
- For reproducibility, you can save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive (`File > Save a copy in Drive`).
