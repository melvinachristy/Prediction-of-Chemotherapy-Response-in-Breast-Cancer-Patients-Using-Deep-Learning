# Prediction-of-Chemotherapy-Response-in-Breast-Cancer-Patients-Using-Deep-Learning
**Timeline:** Dec 2024 – May 2025  
**Institution:** Karunya University  

## Overview
This project develops a **deep learning model** to predict **chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients** using **clinical and imaging data**. The goal is to support **personalized treatment strategies** and **precision medicine** by identifying responders vs. non-responders early, improving therapy effectiveness, and minimizing unnecessary side effects.  

## Objectives
- **Build robust models** to predict chemotherapy response.  
- **Analyze patient-specific features** to identify early treatment efficacy.  
- **Discover biomarkers & clinical factors** influencing therapy success.
